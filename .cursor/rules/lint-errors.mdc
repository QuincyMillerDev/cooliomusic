1. Prioritize maintainable, readable code over silencing lint/type errors.
2. Never introduce hacky workarounds (e.g., dummy attributes, broad getattr fallbacks, suppressing type checks) solely to satisfy tooling.
3. If a linter/type checker produces a false positive, prefer documenting the limitation or adding a focused ignore comment rather than changing runtime behavior.
4. When confronted with a lint violation that requires deeper design work, surface the issue to the user instead of applying quick fixes that degrade code quality.
