Best Practices for Prompting
The key to great results is a descriptive and detailed prompt. The more information you provide, the closer the output will be to your vision.

Be Specific with Genre and Style
Be Specific with Genre and Style
Instead of generic terms like “rock music,” try detailed descriptions:

“Energetic 1980s synth-pop with a driving drum machine beat and male vocals”
“Melancholic indie folk with fingerpicked acoustic guitar and ethereal female harmonies”
“Heavy metal with palm-muted riffs, double bass drums, and aggressive vocals”

Combine mood, instrumentation, tempo, and use case for better results:

“A slow, melancholic piano melody over ambient synth textures, suitable for a tragic film scene”
“Upbeat corporate jingle with bright synthesizers, punchy drums, and an optimistic melody”
“Dark, atmospheric electronic track with deep bass, glitchy percussion, and haunting vocal samples”
Define Instrumentation
Define Instrumentation
Call out specific instruments you want to hear:

“Upbeat funk track with a prominent slap bass line, funky rhythm guitar, and a horn section”
“Classical string quartet with violin, viola, and cello”
“Jazz ensemble with piano, upright bass, brushed drums, and tenor saxophone”
Use Include/Exclude Styles
Use Include/Exclude Styles
Refine your output by explicitly including or excluding certain elements at the track or section level:

Include: “acoustic,” “four-on-the-floor kick”, “reverb-heavy vocals”, “analog warmth”
Exclude: “repetitive structure”, “electronic elements”, “abrupt ending”, “distorted vocals”
Build Section by Section
Build Section by Section
For maximum control, start with a short generation (e.g., 30 seconds for an Intro) and build your song piece by piece.

Generate the Intro and refine until satisfied.
Click ”+ Add Section” to add the next part.
Specify the style and content for the new section (e.g., Verse, Chorus, Bridge).
Use the conversation interface for specific instructions on each part.
Build your track progressively, ensuring each section flows naturally.
Iterate and Refine

Don’t start over if the first generation isn’t perfect. Small changes can have a big impact.

Adjust your prompt and regenerate specific sections.
Use the editing tools to fine-tune individual parts.
Experiment with different style combinations.
